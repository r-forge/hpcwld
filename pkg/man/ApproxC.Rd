\title{
Approximate, dynamic iterative computation of the stability constant for a workload of a High Performance Cluster model
}
\description{
This function calculates the constant C that is used in the stability relation
of a model, which is basically the following: lambda/mu<C, where lambda
is the intensity of task arrivals, and mu is the intensity of service,
in this case it is 1/(mean service time). The constant depends only on
the number of cores in the model and the distribution of core requirement
of tasks. Note that this method of calculation allows to stop on some
depth of dynamics, thus allowing to calculate an approximate value in
faster time. The constant
is valid only for the model with simultaneous task service by cores.

\usage{
ApproxC(s, p, depth=3)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{s}{
number of cores/servers for a HPC
}
  \item{p}{
the distribution of number of cores required by a task, a vector with values for probability of a task requiring 1..s cores
}
  \item{depth}{
the depth of dynamical calculation. By default calculates up to groups of 3 tasks occupying the CPUs. When depth=s, calculates
the exact value. However, depth=s might take a bit more time.
}
}
\value{
The value of a constant C in the relation lambda/mu < C is returned
