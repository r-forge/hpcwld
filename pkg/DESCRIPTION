Description: Probabilistic models describing the behavior 
	of workload and queue on a High Performance Cluster and computing GRID 
	under FIFO service discipline basing on modified Kiefer-Wolfowitz 
	recursion. Also sample data for inter-arrival times, service times, 
	number of cores per task and waiting times of HPC of Karelian 
	Research Centre are included, measurements took place from 06/03/2009 to 02/30/2011.
	Functions provided to import/export workload traces in Standard Workload Format (swf).
	Stability condition of the model may be verified either exactly, or approximately.
